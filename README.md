I am [Pau Pedra](linkedin), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ramon Santamaria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raysan/).

This research project is about how to handle Sprite Rendering Order and Camera Culling focused on 2D tile-based isometric video games though this should still be useful for other types of 2D games. 

This research will be used in an isometric 2D RTS game coded in C++ and using Visual Studio 2019.
